## Description of Design
Design Spec:

Make sure that you use the fully expanded functions for each cin
    + DO NOT use c[i] = g[i] + p[i]c[i-1]
    + Each CLA block should be connected using the Ps and Gs from the previous blocks
    + If you would like to use a different adder, consult with the instructor

+ bitwise AND, OR without the built in &, &&, |, and || operators

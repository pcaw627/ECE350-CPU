# ECE350-CPU
Final project for Duke's Digital Systems class, designing a CPU from scratch in Verilog, and then deploying it on FPGA, and then programming an application to run on it.

Checkpoints for this project include:
+ Building an ALU with various operations and control signals 
+ Building a register file
+ Adding in more complex operations such as multiplication and division (implemented and optimized for hardware using algorithms such as Booth's)
